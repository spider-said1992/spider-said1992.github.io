        Hi there! I am an aspiring web developer.<br>
        It all started back in 2017 when i baught a laptop, I know what your thinking, but please let me explain, I came from a poor background, my father died when i was youn, back then i was still strugling to get my Bachlor Degree by the time i got it he was gone, it pains me that he did not even have a chance to see it or be pround of what i have accomplished.<br>Anyhow time passed by and after so many years searching for a jaob with no vain, I decided its time to invest im myself and since the world is changing so should I. I managed to scramble some money to buy a laptop in order to learn but fortunetlly fate has set other challanges for me first, we did not have the Internet and i have to work part time to provide for my family plus the remain time was never enough to learn.<br>
        Two years latter we have the Internet and i decided its time to invest all the time i could spare to learn this Web Development for a better future. Thats when i discovered all the amazing things the Internet has to offer. I started my journey and let me tell you its <b>Amazing</b> so far. I love what i do and keep doing it. I got some Certificates here and there and SOME day i will make it. <b>I just have to keep going</b>
    </p>
